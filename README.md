## Installing

First clone the repository, then:

For NPM users:

```sh
npm install
```

For yarn users:

```sh
yarn
```

## Building

Since the app uses TypeScript, you should build it before being able to use it.

For NPM users:

```sh
npm run build
```

For yarn users:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Running

If you want to use the default `input.json` file (of course, you could change the content of input.json and test it with different values):

For NPM users:

```sh
npm run start
```

For yarn users:

```sh
yarn start
```

If you want to give it another JSON file:

```sh
node dist/app.js filename.json
```

## Tests

```sh
npm run test
```

For yarn users:

```sh
yarn test
```
